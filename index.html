                Hello, whoever is viewing my website. This is just a simple beginner's project of mine
                meant for HTML and CSS practice; all it does is showcase a few things about myself.
                Go ahead and click the various thingys down below.

                        <p>
                            A wide variety of videogames is in my personal realm of interest.
                            From car racing games, to RPGs, to shooters, to sandbox games -
                            you name it. I even have a love for Minecraft.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <a href="music.html">
                            <div class="img-border"></div>
                            <img src="placeholder.png" alt="Music">
                        </a>
                        <p>
                            Like videogames, my taste in music varies quite wildly as well.
                            Predominantly I enjoy lo-fi, electronic, and some metal. However,
                            I also love videogame music, synthwave/chillwave, ambient music,
                            and more.

                            I am a curious person by nature, which lends itself to my
                            fascination with how the world works. From the sciences of
                            physics, math, chemistry, and biology, to the modern-day 
                            engineering that goes into computers, cars, and lasers, I
                            want to know how things work and why things move and behave
                            the way they do.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <a href="cars.html">
                            <div class="img-border"></div>
                            <img src="placeholder.png" alt="cars">
                        </a>
                        <p>
                            Cars are a thing of beauty. The way they look, the sounds they
                            make, the power they can produce - all reasons to love 'em. Again,
                            I like a wide variety of cars: muscle cars like Mustangs and Challengers,
                            the various Japanese tuners of the Nissan, Mazda, and Honda brands, and
                            some luxury/supercars too, like Aston Martin's, BMW's, and Lamborghini's.
